# Heap-manager-simulation
A simulation of heap management in C

This is a really low level implementation of heap manager only to give an idea of how this concept works.
First fit, Best fit and Next fit allocations are implemented. Also deallocating can be done. There are two lists, namely free list and alloc list containing unallocated memory blocks information and allocated memory blocks information respectively.
